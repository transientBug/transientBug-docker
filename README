This is just a simple dockerfile to support running transientbug inside of a
docker instance.

For systems that docker isn't supported or a pain to use *cough*mac osx*cough*
there is also a Vagrantfile provided that will setup a full Ubuntu 12.04 vm with
docker installed. Inside of this vm you can then build the dockerfile and work
like normal.

The use of the Vagrant managed vm is highly recommened, as it most closely matches
the current servers setup.
